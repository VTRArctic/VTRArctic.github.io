## Reincarnation Tips

Gear can be swapped, but stat point allocations from reincarnations cannot be. After your final reincarnation, you also cannot change your primary stat selection. This makes it extremely important to allocate these stat points wisely, as they are permanent, irreversible decisions.

You should generally aim to allocate your points such that your most important stats end up no higher than about 25-26 **without gear** at the end of your final reincarnation. To do this, you need to know the natural stat maximums for your race and class combination, as well as be aware of other sources of stat point increases.

These include, but are not limited to:
- **Becoming legendary.** Some classes gain stat points when they become legendary.
- **Legendary ranks.** Some legendary ranks also provide stat points.
- **Medals.** Medals can provide +2 to each stat.

This way, we are able to allocate more points in other stats, while still retaining the ability to make use of +stat gear.

As a contrived example, consider the following two players with natural stats of 15 `STR` and 21 `CON`:
- Player 1 was not thinking when he reincarnated. He put all 5 points into `CON`. 
  - With a medal, his `STR` is now 19 and his `CON` is 28.
- Player 2 thinks a little bit before reincarnating. He puts 3 points into `CON` and 2 into `STR`. 
  - With a medal, his `STR` is now 21 and his `CON` is 26.

Can you think of any scenario in which it would be beneficial to be Player 1? What if both players were given a +2 `CON` item, or a weight 23 weapon to wield? Whose stat deficiencies are more easily fixable, e.g. with regular ranks?

In short, aim for 25-26 when allocating stat points. Utility is lost when going over this amount.

### Test Your Reasoning
Suppose our end-game character is a Dargonesti Paladin. Assuming we select `STR` as our primary stat, what is the maximum number of points we should put into `STR` for optimal allocation?

### Jordan's Answer
- The maximum natural roll for a Dargonesti Paladin's `STR` is `19`. 
- Selecting it as our primary stat increases it to `20`. 
- We gain +2 from the Legendary Righteous Indignation rank, increasing it to `22`.
- We can also gain +2 from our medal, increasing it to `24`.
- Thus, we should allocate no more than 2 points to `STR` (ending up at `26`).

## Stats

In Arctic, your base stat range is determined by your class, and then modified by your race.

Two characters of the same class, but different races (or vice versa) may have different stat ranges. Only when two characters share both the same class and race will their base stat ranges be identical. 

For each race + class combination, the game designates a `high` value and a `low` value for each stat. These values differ from each other by exactly 1. 

For example, a `Human` `Warrior`'s `STR` has a `high` value of `18` and a `low` value of `17`.

The game then randomly assigns one of these two values to be your 'true' stat. 

Generally speaking, better characters will have rolled the `high` value in all of their stats.

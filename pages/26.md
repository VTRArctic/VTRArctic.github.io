## Stats

Gear can be swapped, but stat point allocations from reincarnations cannot be. You also cannot change your primary stat selection. This makes it extremely important to allocate these stat points wisely, as they are permanent, irreversible decisions.

You should generally aim to allocate your points such that your most important stats end up at around 26-27 **without gear** at the end of your final reincarnation. To do this, we need to know the natural stat maximums for our race and class combination, as well as be aware of other sources of stat point increases.

These include, but are not limited to:
- Some classes gain stat points when they become legendary, and some legendary ranks also provide stat points.
- Medals, which can provide +2 to each stat.

As a contrived example, suppose our end-game character is a Dargonesti Paladin. Assuming they select `STR` as their primary stat, how many reincarnation points should they allocate in STR?

  The maximum natural roll is 19. Selecting it as a primary stat increases it to 20. They gain +2 from Legendary Righteous Indignation, and +2 from their medal, increasing it to 24.
Thus, they should allocate either 2 or 3 points (26 or 27), but never 4 or 5.

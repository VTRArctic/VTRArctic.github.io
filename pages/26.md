## Stats

Gear can be swapped, but stat point allocations from reincarnations cannot be. You also cannot change your primary stat selection. This makes it extremely important to allocate these stat points wisely, as they are permanent, irreversible decisions.

You should generally aim to allocate your points such that your most important stats end up no higher than about 26-27 **without gear** at the end of your final reincarnation. To do this, you need to know the natural stat maximums for your race and class combination, as well as be aware of other sources of stat point increases.

These include, but are not limited to:
- Some classes gain stat points when they become legendary.
- Some legendary ranks also provide stat points.
- Medals can provide +2 to each stat.

As a contrived example, suppose our end-game character is a Dargonesti Paladin. Assuming they select `STR` as their primary stat, what is the maximum number of points they should put into `STR` for optimal allocation?

  - The maximum natural roll for a Dargonesti Paladin's `STR` is 19. 
  - Selecting it as their primary stat increases it to 20. 
  - They gain +2 from the Legendary Righteous Indignation rank, increasing it to 22.
  - They can also gain +2 from their medal, increasing it to 24.
  - Thus, they should allocate no more than about 2 or 3 points to `STR` (to end up at 26 or 27). They should never allocate more than 3.
